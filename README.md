This is an R package for Coordinate-wise Adaptive Shrinkage Prediction (casp) in a high-dimensional non-exchangeable hierarchical Gaussian model with unknown location as well as unknown spiked covariance structure. CASP uses the results on the behavior of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of high-dimensional sample covariance matrix (Baik and Silverstein, 2006, Onatski, 2012, Paul, 2007), to develop a bias-correction principle that leads to an efficient approach for evaluating the Bayes predictors corresponding to popular loss functions such as quadratic, generalized absolute, and linex losses.
 
How to use this repository?
----------

Soon this repository will hold the R-package casp which is currently under development. Meanwhile you can use the scripts in the folder 'Numerical Experiments' to reproduce the analysis in our paper.
